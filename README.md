## üåê About Aardwolf Social

**Aardwolf Social** is a free and open-source alternative to Facebook that prioritizes user privacy and decentralization. Unlike mainstream platforms that present a single advertising-driven experience, Aardwolf empowers individuals and communities to create unique, customizable spaces while maintaining the ability to interact across different instances.

- **User Privacy First**: No ads, no tracking‚Äîjust a community-first social experience.
- **Decentralized & Customizable**: Each community can have its own Aardwolf server (instance) that fits its specific needs.
- **Open Source**: Built by the community for the community.
